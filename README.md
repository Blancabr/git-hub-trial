# git-hub-trial
Hi, this is a trial to try to figure out how to use GitHub. I will share it with you and see if you can edit, if others can edit/see the text file, etc, to decide if we can use this site to keep the different versions of the GUI. 

Ok, so I tried to search for other documents with the same name (git-hub-trial). Several appeared, and I tried to click on one of them, and it let me see it and edit it. 
I do not know if, if you edit someone else's code, it modifies their code or only your copy of it, or if the can see that someone has suggested an edition and then decide if they want to save it or not... I didn't modify nothing because I don't want to change someone else's code, just in case... 

So, if we upload the GUI code here, everyone will be able to see it and edit it, and there is a button that says "clone or download" or something similar, so everyone could download the code. I don't think it's a good idea to put the code out here in the public... There is a private option for GitHub, but you have to pay around 6 euros per month. 

Try to add something to this txt file and see if I can see the changes as something that some other person suggests, or if they automatically change without my permission, etc.
